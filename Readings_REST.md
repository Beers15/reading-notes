Referenced the source below for answers<sup>1<sup>

1. Who is Roy Fielding?
  
  An individual who helped write the first web servers. He created the REST architectural style for building APIs. 


2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

  This is because those techniques were not designed to do so. The techniques were created by developers that did not have this requirement.

  The REST HTTP protocol (Representation State Transfer)
