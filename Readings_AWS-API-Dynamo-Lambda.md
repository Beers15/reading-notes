## Review, Research, and Discussion
 
---------------

### Vocabulary terms

1) What are serverless functions?

  * Serverless refers to microservice architecture. This type of architecture involves a program being broke up into sub tasks that are distributed to their own containers rather than all tasks existing on one monolithic server. Serverless functions are the same, but broken down into individual functions.
  
2) If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it?

  * I would create small containers on a server that used minimal resources. After this I would create a user interface to allow individual users to add host their own functions in these containers and add some type of permissions system to let them control who can do what on them..

3) Describe how a CDN works

  * A CDN is a network of servers that are interrelated. A CDN exists to distribute specific content as the name suggests.
