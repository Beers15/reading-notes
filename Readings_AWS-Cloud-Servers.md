# Readings: AWS: Cloud Servers
 
## Review, Research, and Discussion
 
---------------

1) Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle 

  * The steps that a describe data flow on the web starting with a client making a request through a browser or some other user-agent and ending with a server sending back a response to the user-agent. 

2) Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC 

  * The computer that serves a web-page or some other data to a client based on the received request.

3) What does it mean to “deploy” an application?

  * This simply means hosting an application on a remote server.

### Vocabulary terms

Server

  * Servers are computers that are part of a network that provide some function to their clients, which are connected to the same network. There are many types of servers that serve different purposes.

Pub/Sub

  * This is a design pattern where subscribers listen to a publishers in order to receive data from them immediately upon emission.  This pattern is often used with messaging apps, streaming apps, and other event driven applications.

WRRC

  * Web Request Reponse Cycle: The cycle that describes the data flow of a user's request as it is sent to an endpoint, through the corresponding server, and then back to the user as a response.

### Preview

2) Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

    * Using EB virtual environments to host complex servers

    * Using and scaling microservices

    * Other services that AWS offers

3) What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?

    * Hosting and configuring robust applications with AWS
