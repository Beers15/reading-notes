# Readings: Component Based UI
 
## Review, Research, and Discussion
 
---------------

1) Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React) <sup>1</sup>

  * Vue, Angular, Mithril, Polymer, Backbone.js

2) Whatâ€™s the difference between a framework and a library?

  * "The difference whether it is a library or framework is whether or not there is an inversion of control." <sup>2</sup> A framework is opinionated and tells the dev what is needed. A library can be used more freely, as a developer needs.

### Vocabulary terms

Rendering

  * When an element in the DOM is rendered, it is made visible in the browser.

Templates

* A predefined layout of components that make a UI. Templates allow developers to not have to start from scratch and quickly spin up aesthetically pleasing UIs.

State

* In React, state is an object that represents a component's behavioral data. By behavioral data, I mean data that can mutate in a way that changes the features of the component, whether that be appearance or functionality.
