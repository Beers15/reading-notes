# Readings: Hash Tables
 
## Vocabulary/definition list

Hash Table: A data structure is built on an array. It uses a hash function to map a string key to an associated index value, resulting in 1+ key value pair(s) at each index. 

Hash: The result of an algorithm that converts a string into a value that could be used for indexing, security reasons, or some other reason.

Bucket: This refers to what is contained at each index a hash table.

Hash Function: Function used by a hash table that takes in a key and maps it to an index within the hash table.
 
Chaining: Multiple keys can hash to the same value in a hash map. Chaining is the process of having the collision index contain a data structure that links the corresponding values together. This allows more than one to be stored.

Collision: This occurs when 2+ keys have the same hash and therefore map to the same index in the hash table.
