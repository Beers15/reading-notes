## Review, Research, and Discussion
 
---------------
All answers taken from resources supplied in prompt

1) How does React differ from vanilla JS/HTML/CSS?

  * React is a UI library (or borderline framework) that is uses component based architecture to design front-ends. It uses JSX, which is a syntax that can be used to write html using JS. JSX can have css applied to it with ease.

2) What is the primary difference between a function component and a class component?

  * Functional components are as the name suggests are React components wrapped in functions. They require hooks to take advantage of React state. Class components are wrapped in a class that extends from React.Component and can use state without hooks.

### Vocabulary terms

Functional Components 

  * Components that are wrapped in a function instead of a class that extends from React.Component. 

Children / Child Components

  * In React, children components receive props from their parent component as part of React's downward data flow.
