## Review, Research, and Discussion
 
---------------

### Vocabulary terms

1) Describe “The Cloud”

  * The cloud refers to the collection of servers that host software and perform services host on the web.
  
2) What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?

  * Containers are wrappers for code bundled with their dependencies, runtime environments, versions of programming languages,etc that are hosted on a cloud server. Servers can spawn up multiple containers of a certain type and serve them to clients

3) What is auto-scaling?

  * This is when a server automatically adjusts its power by increasing or decreasing the amount resources it needs to meet the current needs.

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoscaling

4) What is bandwidth?

  * Bandwidth is the maximum data transfer rate of a network.

5) How do cloud providers compute service costs?

  * Costs are calculated based on memory usage, hardware cost, labor cost, cost per period of time the service is used, cost per deployment, and a multitude of other factors.

### Document the following Vocabulary Terms

Server Instances

  * Every time a server is launched, an instance is created from that specific cloud infrastructure on some remote machine. This instance is launched on a virtual machine hosted on that server.

Containers

  * Containers are bundled software coupled with its dependencies, runtime environment, etc that runs on a server.

Cloud Services

  * Tech companies provide the means to perform a multitude of computation tasks on their remote servers. Cloud services refers to their offers along with the software and infrastructure they sell/lease to perform said tasks.

Cloud Architecture

  * The technology components used to build a cloud server:

    * front-end platform
    * back-end platform (for data storage)
    * a cloud-based delivery methodology
    * a network to connect all of these components

AWS

  * Amazon Web Services: A major cloud service provider 

EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku

  * Both these are cloud service platforms. Heroku is built on EC2. EC2/Beanstalk services have more of a pay as you go model, Heroku tends to have you pay for extra services prior to their use.
